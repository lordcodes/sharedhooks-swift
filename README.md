## Features

#### ‚òëÔ∏è Store Git hooks within a project

Provide Git hooks for all project contributors to share.

#### ‚òëÔ∏è Easily install into Git

Simply run a single command and a Git hook will be installed that runs your project-specific Git hooks.

#### ‚òëÔ∏è Easily uninstall

A command is provided to remove any installed hooks.

&nbsp;

## Install

The primary intention was to use SwiftHooks as a [Tuist](https://github.com/tuist/tuist) plugin, however, it can also be used as a standard CLI tool as well.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏é üñ• As a Tuist Plugin

To set up as a Tuist plugin in your project simply follow the [Tuist plugin install instructions](https://docs.tuist.io/plugins/using-plugins/) using the [latest version](https://github.com/lordcodes/swifthooks/releases/latest).

Add the plugin to `Config.swift`.

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let config = Config(
    plugins: [
        .git(url: "https://github.com/lordcodes/swifthooks.git", tag: "{ENTER_LATEST_VERSION}")
    ]
)
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏é üñ• Standalone via Swift Package Manager

SwiftHooks can be easily installed globally using Swift Package Manager.

```terminal
 git clone https://github.com/lordcodes/swifthooks-swift
 cd swifthooks-swift
 make install
```

This will install swifthooks into `/usr/local/bin`. If you get a permission error it may be that you don't have permission to write there in which case you just need to adjust permissions using `sudo chown -R $(whoami) /usr/local/bin`.

You can uninstall it again using `make uninstall` which simply deletes it from `/usr/local/bin`.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏é üç∫ Homebrew

Support for Homebrew may be planned in the future.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏é üì¶ As a Swift package

To install SwiftHooks for use in your own Swift code, add it is a Swift Package Manager dependency within your `Package.swift` file. For help in doing this, please check out the Swift Package Manager documentation.

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/lordcodes/swifthooks", exact: "0.0.1")
```

&nbsp;
